# Contributing standards

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Medea. To ensure that your contributions
are incorporated speedily, and for the benefit of all contributors to Medea
(present and future), please read, and follow, the following standards.

# Before you start

If you are unsure of what needs doing, or would like to take up a pressing task,
check `TODO.md` for ideas. If you want to take something up, but aren't sure
what might be involved or how, open an issue 'claiming' it, and tag a maintainer
(either Koz Ross or Shaurya Gupta).

Ensure that you've read, and are familiar with, the code quality standards,
described in `STANDARDS.md`, as well as what GHC versions we support (in
`README.md`).

# What your contribution has to do

If you are contributing source code, ensure that it follows all the requirements
set out in `STANDARDS.md`. If you find a violation of these somewhere in the
Medea codebase, let us know (or, if you like, fix it) - we appreciate it very
much! Medea follows the [PVP][pvp].

If you are contributing documentation (of any sort), please ensure that:

* Your documentation is free of spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors;
* Any code examples are correct and working; and
* Markdown renders properly on Github.

In either case, please submit your changes via PR, and ensure a maintainer
(either Koz Ross or Shaurya Gupta) is tagged for review. Ensure that
``CHANGELOG.md`` reflects your changes; add them to the Dev section.
