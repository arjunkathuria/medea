# Medea

## What is this?

Medea is a schema language for JSON document structure. It is similar to [JSON
Schema][json-schema], but is designed to be simpler and more self-contained.

This repo contains both a specification (in ``SPEC.md``) and a reference
implementation (in Haskell). We also have a [PureScript implementation available][medea-ps].

## Why Medea?

## Getting started 

For an easy starting point, check out ``TUTORIAL.md``, which describes basic usage
of Medea, with examples. For a more detailed description of Medea's capabilities
and schema language, ``SPEC.md`` has you covered. 

We also provide a collection of Medea schema files, designed for conformance
testing, in the ``conformance`` directory.
